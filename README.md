## What is This?
Hypothes.is is Open Source web page annotation software that provide public and private annotation.

Unfortunately, the long awaited Firefox plugin still in development and only bookmarklet provided. The bookmarklet has limitation regarding sites with strict Content-Security-Policy. Therefor, this addon allows bypassing Hypothes.is CDN to serve it's content on any sites.

## Usage
Visit [Mozilla Firefox Addon page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hypothes-is-bookmarklet/) then install the extension.
In the near future, we may also provide installable versions on [Releases](./releases) section.

To build yourself, see [this reference](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/).

## Roadmap
This plugin is usable already, but I plan to add more features.

- URL whitelist / blacklist
- Easy user interface
